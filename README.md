# My Reactea App

See Reactea [here.](https://github.com/e9x/reactea)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but was modified according to the [Reactea quickstart](https://github.com/e9x/reactea/blob/master/QUICKSTART.md).

This exists to demonstrate the features of Reactea, test functionality, and to develop a user-first experience for Reactea.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
